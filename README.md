# walmartsalesdata
Overview: This project focuses on analyzing walmart sales data using SQL, specifically MySQL. The main goal was to clean the dataset, handle duplicates, manage missing data, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into layoff trends across industries, company sizes, and time periods. The insights derived can be useful for understanding broader economic patterns and preparing for future workforce shifts.

The primary objective of this project is to:

Clean and prepare walmart sales dataset for analysis.
Identify and remove duplicate entries.
add necessary columns and rows.
Explore trends and patterns in sales, focusing on factors such as cities, product line, product revenue e.t.c
Provide insights that can help understand how elocation or market shifts affect sales.
Data Source The data used in this project was obtained from a public dataset. The dataset includes information on the walmart sales that compricews of location, products e.t.c

Process Outline The analysis was conducted in two main phases:

Data Cleaning: To ensure data consistency and accuracy by handling missing data and duplicate records.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To gain insights into sales patterns and trends across cities, product line e.t.c

Future Work Potential next steps to build on this project include:
Visualization: Adding data visualization (using PowerBI, or Python's Matplotlib/Seaborn) to create dashboards for interactive exploration. 
Predictive Modeling: Using historical data to forecast future sales pattern. 
Product Comparison: Conducting a more detailed industry-specific analysis to see which products are more susceptible to sales under different economic and physical conditions.
